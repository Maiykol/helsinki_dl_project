    "**Due Thursday, May 20, before 23:59.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to learn to assign the correct labels to a set of images.  The images are originally from a photo-sharing site and released under Creative Commons-licenses allowing sharing.  The training set contains 20 000 images. We have resized them and cropped them to 128x128 to make the task a bit more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're only giving you the code for downloading the data. The rest you'll have to do yourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some comments and hints particular to the image project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One image may belong to many classes in this problem, i.e., it's a multi-label classification problem. In fact there are images that don't belong to any of our classes, and you should also be able to handle these correctly. Pay careful attention to how you design the outputs of the network (e.g., what activation to use) and what loss function should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the dataset is pretty imbalanced, don't focus too strictly on the outputs being probabilistic. (Meaning that the right threshold for selecting the label might not be 0.5.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image files can be loaded as numpy matrices for example using `imread` from `matplotlib.pyplot`. Most images are color, but a few grayscale. You need to handle the grayscale ones somehow as they would have a different number of color channels (depth) than the color ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the exercises we used e.g., `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to handle the loading of the data in suitable batches. Here, you need to handle the dataloading yourself.  The easiest way is probably to create a custom `Dataset`. [See for example here for a tutorial](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-custom-dataset-examples)."
